More specifically, these scripts interrogates possible correlations and/or associations between Welcome Buddy performance scores and relevant demographic characteristics, analyses chat data from the “Ask ARU” chat spaces of Welcome Buddies and their assigned new student cohort for formality, warmth and helpfulness metrics and conducts sentiment analysis (both supervised and unsupervised) on open-ended exit survey questions from new students. Results indicate a high level of student satisfaction with the Welcome Buddy scheme. Results also indicate that high Welcome Buddy performance is significantly associated with Welcome Buddies who are female, older, and engage in informal, highly helpful and warm communication within their chat spaces. These findings demonstrate the utility of supervised and unsupervised sentiment analysis, descriptive statistics, and regression models in evaluation of student ambassador schemes at universities.
